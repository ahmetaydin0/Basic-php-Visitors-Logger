# PHP IP Logger

This code logs the IP addresses and user agents of visitors to a website using PHP. The code can be customized to skip logging of specific user agents, such as bots, by adjusting the `$skipsmalluseragent` (default = False) variable. The logs are saved to a text file, `logs.txt`, which is appended with new log entries every time the code is executed.

## Usage

1. Upload `logger.php` file to the root directory of your website.
2. Call the logger by including it in the pages you wish to log visits to. For example, in the header of your HTML file, include the following line: 
```php
<?php include("logger.php"); ?>
```
